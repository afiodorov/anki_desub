# AnkiDesubber

This application is supposed to take a bunch of subbed images and create
nice flashcards out of them.

The flashcards should have a transcribed text and an image at the front and a
translated text at the back.

This is designed so that I can simply take screenshots whilst watching a movie
in a foreign language and then create flashcards automatically.
